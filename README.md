# 🤟 Sign Language Recognition System

This project is my graduation project focused on building an intelligent system that can recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text, aiming to bridge the communication gap between deaf individuals and the hearing community.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
 system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize hand gestures corresponding to letters or words in sign language. The goal is to enable real-time translation of signs to text to aid communication.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Recognize static or dynamic sign language gestures
- Translate signs into readable text in real-time or near real-time
- Provide an accessible interface for users

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras (or any ML framework you used)
- MediaPipe 
- Jupyter Notebook ....etc
